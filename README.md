# DevSecOps with Okta

Our understanding of Dev(Sec)Ops differs depending on backgrounds, experiences and job titles we might have, but at its
heart, Dev(Sec)Ops is the union of people, practices and tools to deliver value. Stop the inside the box thinking: You
are no longer responsible just for writing code that kinda works, it also needs to be secure from the beginning
(often referred to as "Security by Design") and maintainable, so it won't cause issues once it's in production.

We know that companies embodying the DevOps culture achieve more, because we can put numbers behind that. So let's
explore where Okta is fitting into this and how we can help you securing your infrastructure and other key (business)
assets by using an identity-first, zero trust approach.
